# KamiLimu IoT Track codebase
---

This repo contains my ongoing work in KamiLimu IoT track. 

Folders are divided into `reviewtask<x>` and `task<x>`.

`Reviewtask<x>` means that the folder contains work that we have gone through with my mentor while `task<x>` contains my work before the review. `<x>` x stands for task number.
