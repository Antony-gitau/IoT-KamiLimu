# KamiLimu IoT Track codebase
---

This repo contains my ongoing work in KamiLimu IoT track. 
---

Folders are divided into `reviewtask<x>` and `task<x>`.
---

`Reviewtask<x>` means that the folder contains work that we have gone through with my mentor while `task<x>` contains my work before the review. `<x>` x stands for task number.

**note**

I had created some repos for some task:
+ [Task 2](https://github.com/Antony-gitau/webservers-iot-kamilimu-task2) before review.
+ [Task 1](https://github.com/Antony-gitau/review-task1-iot-kamilimu) after review.
